# üìä Project: Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

## üéØ Project Objective  
The goal of this project is to help the telecom company **Interconnect** reduce customer churn by creating a supervised machine learning model capable of predicting whether a customer is likely to cancel their contract. The model returns `1` for customers likely to churn and `0` for those expected to stay.

## ‚úÖ Results Achieved  
The project followed a complete data science pipeline and achieved excellent results:

- Successful integration of four datasets: contract, personal, internet, and phone service information  
- Cleaning and simplification of categorical and object-type columns  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) structured into thematic steps to extract insights  
- Identification of behavior patterns linked to customer churn  
- Training and evaluation of five different models, including logistic regression, random forest, and boosting algorithms  
- Use of cross-validation and GridSearch for model optimization  
- Final model reached **AUC-ROC above 0.89**, significantly above the project‚Äôs performance threshold
